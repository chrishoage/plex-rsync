#Plex Rsync
##What?
This is a tool that allows you to browse a local plex library and start an rsync job.

##Why?
I was tired of constructing these commands either by hand or though carbon copy cloner. I also wanted to learn Redux, so this is the project is the result.

##Notes
This project currently fits my specific use case only. I plan on flushing it out more in the future.

##TODO (in no particular order)
1. Add sorting and filtering
2. Add artwork and descriptions to media
3. Allow for other environments. Currently this will only work with OSX
4. Allow for rsync over SSH
5. Clean up UX. I have thrown this together mostly thinking only about code. Would welcome suggestions.
6. Add tests
7. Allow failed rsync jobs to be restarted/resumed
8. Move plex config to settings tab in app.

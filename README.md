#Plex Rsync
##What?
This is a tool that allows you to browse a local plex library and start an rsync job.

##Why?
I was tired of constructing these commands either by hand or though carbon copy cloner. I also wanted to learn Redux, so this is the project is the result.

##Notes
This project currently fits my specific use case only. I plan on flushing it out more in the future.

##TODO
- Add sorting and filtering
- Add artwork and descriptions to media
- Allow for other environments. Currently this will only work with OSX
- Allow for rsync over SSH
- Clean up UX. I have thrown this together mostly thinking only about code. Would welcome suggestions.
- Add tests
- Allow failed rsync jobs to be restarted/resumed
- Move plex config to settings tab in app.
